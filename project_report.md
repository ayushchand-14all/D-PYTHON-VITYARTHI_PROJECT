PROJECT REPORT

Numerical Mastermind – A Python-Based Number Guessing Game


---

1. Introduction

The Numerical Mastermind project is a Python implementation of a logic-based number-guessing game inspired by the classic “Mastermind.”
The goal of the game is to guess a 4-digit secret key generated by the computer. Each digit in the key is unique and randomly selected.

The player must use logical deduction, pattern recognition, and feedback from previous guesses to determine the secret number within a limited number of attempts.


---

2. Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

To implement game logic using Python programming.

To apply concepts of loops, conditionals, functions, and input validation.

To practice random number generation and frequency counting using built-in modules.

To enhance problem-solving and debugging skills.

To create an interactive command-line game that provides meaningful feedback to the player.

3. Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3

Modules Used:

random → for generating a random key

collections.Counter → for counting digit frequencies


Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (or any terminal-based Python environment)

4. Problem Description

In traditional Mastermind, a codemaker creates a secret pattern, and the codebreaker tries to guess it using hints.

In this version:

The computer acts as the codemaker.

The player is the codebreaker.

The secret key is a 4-digit number with no repeated digits.

The player gets 12 attempts to guess the key.


After each guess, feedback is provided based on:

✔ Position:

Number of digits that are correct and in the correct position.

✔ Exist:

Number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position.

This feedback helps the player refine future guesses.

5. System Design

5.1 Workflow

1. Generate a random 4-digit key.


2. Display the game title and instructions.


3. Loop for up to 12 attempts:

Take user input.

Validate the guess.

Compare guess with the key.

Calculate position and exist counts.

Store each guess in history.



4. Display feedback after each guess.


5. End game:

If guessed correctly → success message.

If attempts are exhausted → show the secret key.

6. Code Explanation (Block-by-Block)

6.1 Key Generation

A random 4-digit number with unique digits is generated using random.sample.

6.2 Guess Validation

Checks if:

Guess is 4 digits

Only numeric

Digits are not repeated


6.3 Feedback Calculation

Correct positions are counted directly (digit + position match).

Counter is used to find total matching digits.

exist = total matches – correct positions.


6.4 History Management

Stores the last 6 guesses with their results for better user experience.

6.5 Main Game Loop

Handles input, feedback, attempts, and end conditions.

7. Sample Output

Numerical Mastermind (4 digits, no repeats)

--- Guess History (Last 6) ---
No guesses yet.
-----------------------------

Guess 1: 1234
  1234 -> position:1 exist:1

Guess 2: 5678
  5678 -> position:0 exist:2

...
Correct! The key was 5071

8. Applications

This project helps understand:

Logical game algorithms

Input validation

Randomized behavior in programs

Data structures like Counter

Interactive programming in Python


It also demonstrates structured coding and modular design.

9. NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
    
    1. Performance
The Mastermind application should achieve a response time of less than 1 second for game actions, ensuring that users can interact seamlessly without delays. The system must efficiently support up to 500 simultaneous players, providing a smooth gaming experience even during peak usage.

2. Security
To safeguard user data and game integrity, the application must implement strong security protocols. This includes secure user authentication, data encryption during transmission, and regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, ensuring a safe environment for all players.

3. Usability
The user interface of the Mastermind game should be designed for ease of use, allowing players of all skill levels to engage without confusion. Clear instructions, intuitive navigation, and responsive design must be incorporated to enhance the overall user experience and encourage player retention.

4. Scalability
The system architecture should be designed to scale efficiently, accommodating an increasing number of users and game sessions without compromising performance. This includes the ability to add resources dynamically as user demand grows, ensuring that the application remains responsive as its user base expands.



11. Conclusion

The Numerical Mastermind project is a simple yet effective example of applying core Python concepts to create a fully functional game. <br> It enhances logical reasoning, promotes clean coding practices, and demonstrates how user interaction can be handled effectively in a terminal environment.
