# Mastermind Project Statement

## Problem Statement
The classic game of Mastermind, where players try to crack a hidden code, has long been a favorite for puzzle enthusiasts. However, many existing versions fall short in terms of engagement and accessibility. Our goal with this project is to create a vibrant online version of Mastermind that not only captures the essence of the game but also offers a modern, interactive experience. By addressing these shortcomings, we aim to bring players together in an exciting and user-friendly environment.

## Scope of the Project
This project will focus on developing a web-based Mastermind game that allows players to compete against each other or challenge an AI. Our scope includes:
- Crafting a user-friendly interface that makes gameplay smooth and enjoyable.
- Introducing multiple difficulty levels to appeal to both beginners and seasoned players.
- Implementing real-time multiplayer capabilities for a dynamic gaming experience.
- Enabling user account features to track game statistics and progress.
- Ensuring the game is accessible across different devices and platforms.

## Target Users
We envision our target audience to be quite diverse, including:
- Casual gamers looking for a fun way to pass the time with a challenging puzzle.
- Friends and families who want to connect and play together online.
- Puzzle lovers eager to test and improve their deduction skills.
- Educational institutions that might use the game as a tool for teaching logic and critical thinking.

## High-Level Features
To make the Mastermind experience truly engaging, we plan to incorporate several key features:
- **User Registration and Login**: A secure system for players to create and manage their accounts.
- **Single and Multiplayer Modes**: Options for playing solo or teaming up with friends.
- **Difficulty Settings**: Various levels to suit different skill levels, ensuring everyone can enjoy the game.
- **Real-time Leaderboards**: Showcasing top players and their scores to encourage friendly competition.
- **Game History and Statistics**: Allowing players to track their performance and see how they’ve improved over time.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Providing helpful guidance for newcomers to learn the rules and strategies.
